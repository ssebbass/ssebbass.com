I hope this can be a great point of encounter with you people, to share some of my knowledge and some of my “adventures” as a a father, a husband and the IT Guy from some enterprise.
I’ve been living with my loving wife for several years, and we have a great son.
I’ve been living in Buenos Aires since 2001; also I like to work with computers, even before to know what it’s to work :).
Right now I’m working as a Linux/Unix Architect at and enterprise that administrate and on demand streaming site (not Netflix).

Well this is my personal page, I hope you enjoy it.
